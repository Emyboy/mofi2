        <p>ABUJA— As part of efforts to ensure an all-round development and modernization of the country's
aviation sector, the Ministry of Finance Incorporated, MOFI, on Tuesday met with the Honourable
Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika to discuss areas of collaboration and partnerships between the two
organizations.</p>

<p>The MOFI delegation to the Honourable Minister was led by the Chief Executive Officer, Dr Armstrong
Takang who made the case for additional investments for the crucial overhaul of the country's Aviation
sector.</p>

<p>Dr Takang further stressed that it is crucial that the FGN derives optimal risk-adjusted returns on the
management of its assets and investments following recent approval to create a National Asset Register
(NAR) by President Buhari. While stating that the Ministry of Aviation represents one of the biggest
supervisors of Nigeria's assets through its sister agencies, Dr Takang reiterated the need for sustainable
partnership to support sundry economic activities in the airports.</p>

<p>The MOFI team has been mandated by Mr. President to create a comprehensive National Asset Register
(NAR) by aggregating, profiling, and managing all national assets and investments, the NAR will be
harnessed to strengthen our fiscal and economic realities and the optimization of our investments and
assets. As a result, Dr. Takang emphasized that it is key that all assets of the Ministry are captured in the
NAR in line with the vision of Mr. President to properly manage its assets and investments</p>

<p>The MOFI CEO also commented that the development and modernization of the country's airports are
crucial for socio-economic development and that while the Ministry had made positive improvements,
they believe that more capital investment was required to attract more passengers, cargo movement, and
facilitate trade.</p>

<p>Dr Takang indicated that MOFI was interested in supporting the Ministry's efforts in airport development
and modernization, including upgrading existing infrastructure and constructing new airports where
necessary.</p>

<p>The MOFI delegation assured the Honourable Minister of their strong interest and unwavering support
for the growth and expansion of Nigerian airlines by exploring ways in which they can provide financing
and investments for airlines to expand their fleets, enhance their services, and compete on the global
stage. This statement was made against the backdrop of the Ministry's efforts to launch the “Nigeria Air”
brand and establish the Nigerian Aviation Leasing Company.</p>

<p>Sirika who is a member of the MOFI governing council, commended the new board of MOFI and gave
assurances that MOFI would be included in the National Aviation Roadmap in no distant time.</p>

<p>According to him, we have the concession of the airport, we have the airlines, we have the cargo, we have
the MRO, and ALC, those are the legs of the roadmap. Ministry of Aviation will ensure that MOFI is integral
to these plans. He concluded by saying that the Ministry remains committed to ensuring that President
Buhari's mandates are adequately delivered.</p>

        <p>The MOFI management team, led by the Managing Director of MOFI, Armstrong Takang, paid a
courtesy visit to the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) on the 6th of February 2023
to assess the foundations of MOFI&#39;s involvement with NSIA, review the status of the two
entities, identify areas of collaboration, and take into consideration potential future business
opportunities.</p>

<p>The NSIA, Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority is an independent investment institution
created to empower the Authority to receive, manage and invest funds in a diversified portfolio
of medium and long-term assets on behalf of the Federal Government, State Governments,
Federal Capital Territory, and Local Governments Area Councils. Simply put, its major function is
to make investments that will build, provide, and sustain economic stability for all Nigerians.</p>

<p>It was concluded in the meeting that MOFI should exercise its authority in the following NSIA
investments:</p>

<p><strong>The Presidential Fertilizer Initiative (PFI):</strong> which aims to lessen the difficulties faced by Nigerian
farmers by preventing the importation of blended fertilizers and supporting the production of
domestic NPK fertilizer.</p>

<p><strong>Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund:</strong> This initiative was established to fund critical
road and power projects across the country. It is aimed at eliminating the risks of project
funding, cost variation and completion that have plagued the development of the nation’s
critical infrastructure assets over the last few decades.</p>

<p><strong>Kano Solar Project:</strong> To address a lack of electricity supply from the national grid, the federal
government started building a solar power plant at Kumbotso, Kano State. A 10 megawatt solar
power plant will be built and installed as part of the N4 billion crucial project, which will enable
alternative energy production and supply for industrial consumption.</p>

<p><strong>Family Homes Funds Limited:</strong> Family Homes Funds Limited (FHFL) is a social housing financing
fund aimed at improving the quality of life of Nigerians on low income through the provision of
affordable housing. The aim of the Fund is to provide long-term low-cost mortgage finance by
raising capital from the private sector, multilateral agencies, and impact investors.</p>
        
<p><strong>Funds for Agricultural Finance in Nigeria (FAFFIN):</strong> The Fund for Agricultural Finance in Nigeria
is an innovative agriculture-focused private equity fund that provides tailored investment
capital and technical assistance to high-growth, commercially attractive agricultural SMEs
across all regions in Nigeria.</p>

<p><strong>Development Bank of Nigeria:</strong> the bank exists to alleviate financing constraints faced by Micro,
Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (MSMEs) in Nigeria.</p>

<p>Given the mandate for MOFI to ensure all state-owned entities are professionally managed and
positioned to achieve greater economic impact, the involvement of MOFI in the
aforementioned federal government investments will undoubtedly result in an excellent return
on investment for the Nigerian government.</p>
